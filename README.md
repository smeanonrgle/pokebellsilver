# Pokémon Bell Silver

This is an in-process romhack of Pokemon Silver to add minor but useful additions. Mostly attempts at bugfixes and OP moves and shit.

To-Do:
- Decapitalize all Pokemon/move/item names
- Add Running Shoes
- Make Pokemon like Houndoor and Larvitar available before post-game
- Reusable TMs
- Reuse Repels
- Make Waterfall, Flash, Whirpool into TMs
- ???
